# Training-Neural-Networks-for-Stock-Price-Prediction--Machine-Learning
Prediction of stock market using Machine Learning algorithms. The good thing about stock price history is that itâ€™s basically a well labelled preformed dataset. 
The data set used in this project is of Stock Price Prediction List of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia.
Experimented with a real world dataset, and explored how machine learning algorithms can be used to find the patterns in data. 

Keywords: Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Classification, Supervised learning, Artificial Intelligence.

Stock markets are where individual and institutional investors come together to buy and sell shares in a public venue. The major socio-economic role of a stock exchange is the valuing of securities and the provision of a well-run market-place where investors can buy and sell shares.
The term stock price refers to the current price that a share of stock is trading for on the market.

PURPOSE:

WHY DO WE HAVE TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE?
The very first question that we encounter is that:

CAN STOCK PRICE BE PREDICTED?
The truth is, we can't. The future, like any complex problem, has far too many variables to be predicted. Quantitative models, historical models, even psychic models have all been tried, but all in vain. 

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. 

The Whole Idea

A stock price may depend on several factors operating in the current world and
stock market. We will try to take into account a combination of mainly two
factors:

1. The impact and correlation of stock prices of other companies i.e, how
the increase and decrease of stock prices of the other companies affect the
stock price of a given target company
2. The past performances and records of the target company

The future enhancement includes comparing the accuracy of LSTM with
other prediction algorithms. LSTM is more accurate than any other
prediction algorithms.

I am looking forward to implement other techniques and trying to
make the accuracy better and also looking forward to implement the
prediction in a web application.
